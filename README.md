# ML-Projects

A collection of ML projects and tutorials in Python to keep myself busy in leizure.

## Contents

- Regression
- Neural Networks

## Supporting blog posts

I greatly support the [Feynman technique](https://www.jousefmurad.com/productivity/the-feynman-technique/) of learning and I learned to enjoy the process of technical writing. It is a method of iterative training in order to develop deep understanding of new concepts while keeping the explanation in simple terms. A fine step towards knowledge distillation.
